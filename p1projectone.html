                <p style="color: #000000; font-size: 125%">When creating the nametag, I started by downloading the keychain first name last name.3mf file and opening it in PrusaSlicer. Being my first time using the program, I explored around with my limited understanding of the customizable aspects of the keychain, where I ended up choosing the PT Sans font as well as moving my last name to the right by changing the world coordinates. After exporting, I was ready to print.
    The base was printed perfectly, but before I could change colors and print my name on top, we had a lesson in class that took around 30 minutes. By this time, my project had timed out and cooled down, meaning I was unable to continue from where I was and had to reprint. This taught me a valuable lesson in paying attention to the 3D printer and making sure everything is running smoothly. 
    My second print went off without a hitch, and I was able to successfully print the name tag with two separate colors for the base and my name. This was a great introductory project into the world of modeling and printing.

                 <p style="color: #000000; font-size: 125%">For my second print, I decided on an extreme bridge design with emphasis on a large overhang between the two foundations of the bridge. When importing this design into PrusaSlicer, it gave me a little more information on 3MF and STL files. STL files have the model and nothing more, while 3MF files contain the model as well as other helpful information such as supports, orientation, and printing specifications. </p>

     <p style="color: #000000; font-size: 125%">The printing process started standard, with the Prusa Mini+ being able to handle the foundations of the bridge relatively well. Once getting to the deck of the bridge, problems began to occur. As the printer went back and forth between the foundations, the deck began to sag. Aptly called poor bridging, this happens due to a lack of supports when creating a large overhang. 
    Another interesting development is that as the bridge progressed, one of the foundations rose up and lost contact with the print bed. Known as warping, this was likely caused by contraction by the plastic as it cooled, bringing the foundations closer together. The large amounts of stringing and oozing was likely caused by this contraction, as the bridge would be out of place from its initially printed position. Overall I had a ton of fun with this project and can't wait to do more printing!
