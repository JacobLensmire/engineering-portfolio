                <p style="color: #000000; font-size: 125%">(From left to right) Image 1 shows navigation without one or more of the 5 senses, as it shows that Brandeis has put forth efforts to support those who struggle with hearing. Image 2 is a broad form of assistence, as the elevator is meant for those who are physically impaired. Image 3 shows design for aging, as the large and obvious railings on both sides of the stairs will likely help older people who would need assistance going up or down stairs. Image 4 presents evidence of design for young children as the water cooler is very low to the ground, providing easy access for chilren. Image 5 shows design for wheeled mobile gear, as there is a clearly designated and present place for people who use bikes as transportation to safely secure their vehicles while in class. </p>

                 <p style="color: #000000; font-size: 125%">(From left to right) Image 6 shows design with physical barriers as there are very present and clear spikes in a major walkway, likely meant to stop larger vehicles from entering, but could prevent movement of the average person. Image 7 shows design with lack of information as the purpose of the paper is to be a guide in an emergency, but it has not been replaced or updated and is currently blank. Image 8 presents design with an absence of help because though pointing in a general direction, attempting to actually find a specific room proves very difficult without any other guidance.</p>

                <h1 style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold">Designs Priorities in the built environment</h1>
                 <p style="color: #000000; font-size: 125%">(From left to right) Image 9 shows design for historical specifiy because, as I interpreted it, the stairway and area around the historic statue was designed to bring attention to the historical monument and invite students to pursue further. Image 10 shows design for environmental sustainability because there are three clear and distinct places to discard trash, with emphasis put on recycling and composting as much as possible. Image 11 shows design for health and well-being, as there is a clear intent of providing a sense of well-being and reducing stress about not being able to recieve help in an emergency. Image 12 shows our chosen design priority, which is safety. The sublte blinking lights on the stop sign show a deliberate action that was taken to make crossing the road safer by bringing more attention of the stop sign to the driver.</p>
